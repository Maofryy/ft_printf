Change get to arg using strchr
	if didnt find, print format and return the len
	if found, print with the length between the two adresses with a putnstr ?
Change the function handling format with char ** and not const char * restrict sht, cast from main function
Add itoa_base, itoA_base and lltoa_base, then add in print args, maybe find a better way than this one, like a function pointer.
When all the converision the char* done,
	work on the h,hh,l,ll and L flags, just need some casting imo
After that figure out precision, round up for numeric conversions, and only "putnstr" for printing the passed number of characters.
Then the Field Width expand with zeros or smth ?? according to the first format flags, some maybe do the two lasts/firsts. ?
That should be enough for now tho
